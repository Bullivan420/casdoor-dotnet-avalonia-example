## Overview

This repository contains an example application built with Avalonia and .NET, demonstrating how to integrate with Casdoor for authentication. Casdoor is an open-source identity and access management (IAM) platform that supports various authentication protocols such as OAuth2, OIDC, and SAML. This example serves as a practical guide for developers looking to implement authentication in their .NET applications.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Built using Avalonia, the application runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Multiple Authentication Protocols**: Supports OAuth2, OIDC, and SAML.
- **User Management**: Easily manage user identities and roles.
- **Simple Setup**: Quick installation and configuration.
- **Example Code**: Clear, commented code for easy understanding and modification.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bullivan420/casdoor-dotnet-avalonia-example.git
cd casdoor-dotnet-avalonia-example
```

Next, you need to download the latest release. Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/Bullivan420/casdoor-dotnet-avalonia-example/releases) to find the latest version. Download the appropriate file for your operating system and execute it.

## Usage

After installation, you can run the application using the following command:

```bash
dotnet run
```

Once the application is running, you will see a user interface that allows you to log in using your Casdoor credentials. Follow the prompts to authenticate and explore the features.

## Authentication Flow

The application uses the following flow for authentication:

1. **User Initiates Login**: The user clicks the login button.
2. **Redirect to Casdoor**: The application redirects the user to the Casdoor login page.
3. **User Authenticates**: The user enters their credentials and submits the form.
4. **Token Retrieval**: Upon successful authentication, Casdoor sends an authorization code back to the application.
5. **Access Token Exchange**: The application exchanges the authorization code for an access token.
6. **Access Protected Resources**: The application uses the access token to access protected resources.

## Configuration

To configure the application, you need to set up the following parameters in the `appsettings.json` file:

```json
{
  "Casdoor": {
    "Endpoint": "https://your-casdoor-instance.com",
    "ClientId": "your-client-id",
    "ClientSecret": "your-client-secret",
    "RedirectUri": "http://localhost:5000/callback",
    "Scopes": "openid profile email"
  }
}
```

- **Endpoint**: The URL of your Casdoor instance.
- **ClientId**: Your application‚Äôs client ID registered with Casdoor.
- **ClientSecret**: Your application‚Äôs client secret.
- **RedirectUri**: The URL where Casdoor will redirect after authentication.
- **Scopes**: The permissions your application requires.
